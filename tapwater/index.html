          </div>
          <div class="right">
            <p>
              Communication in the 21st century is complex and exhausting. The
              conversation moves from email to text, to the phone, to an app,
              back to text and as a result, we're pulled in all directions by
              tools designed to seize our attention and keep it captive. In
              building Tapwater, we set out to fix this line of thinking by
              building something you can use when you need it and put down when
              you're done with it. We wanted a tool that could keep these
              complex threads of digital conversation tamed and woven into
              something useful.
              <br />
              <br />
              Tapwater is the tool we wanted to use, so we built the business
              with that in mind. We decided from the beginning to protect users
              from any kind of third-party tracking; the "value" that analytics
              would provide to our business doesn't justify the cost to you, the
              user. Tapwater uses no Google Analytics, Intercom, or tracking
              code of any kind beyond the basic internal tools we use to
              discover bugs within the software. We never share any of your data
              with any third party, and we've listed the services that we use to
              build Tapwater below. We want to foster a healthier, more
              respectful version of the Internet where customers are treated the
              same as if they walked into our office.
